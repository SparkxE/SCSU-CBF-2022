#SCSU Cyberforce 2022
Repo for Cyberforce 2022 SCSU competition web page

This repository (repo) was used for up/downloading source code and other files to & from our 
assigned Web Server VM. Feel free to download and experiment with it yourself, 
but I would recommend using a new repo for future competitions or projects since it is named after
the fictional company that the web page was meant to represent. 

Feel free to use it to learn & practice Git commands, learn React.js or even HTML if you feel like it!

The way this was used in "production" was by running "sudo PORT=80 npm run start" in a new terminal window 
so that I could still run other commands in the first window while (hopefully) keeping the WebApp running. 
This method probably isn't the best, and I don't know how secure it is, but it worked better than trying 
to get the Apache service to render the page by itself. 

React is fairly user-friendly, and React WebApps are generally hosted through Node.js, which is why you need
Node and npm. Plus, npm allows you to add additional modules to your code that aren't included in the 
basic install, so it's good for experimenting. Plus there's lots of online tutorials if you get stuck!

Good luck, and happy coding!
